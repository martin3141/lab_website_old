            <h2>29th May 2020 - Adaptive Baseline Fitting (ABfit)</h2>
            <p>Very pleased to announce the acceptance of my new MR Spectroscopy analysis method "Adaptive Baseline Fitting" (ABfit), currently in press at Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.949495v2">link to preprint</a>. A badly structured MRS analysis software ramble follows.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, MRS fitting algorithms haven't improved in a significant way since the LCModel method was published, a staggering 27 years ago, and this has been both a blessing and a curse for MRS. A blessing because we've had access to a robust and highly optimised method for an long time, and it has rightly become the standard approach in the literature. A curse because the method is proprietary, relatively costly ($20k), and crucially, key algorithmic details are missing from the original paper - or terse to the point of obfustication.</p>

            <p>Whilst a debate over pros and cons of proprietary vs open source software and data is a lengthy one, it's hard to argue that fMRI has suffered from having three excellent and open analysis packages: AFNI, FSL and SPM. This initial culture of openness (likely thanks to Karl Friston for choosing to release SPM under the GPL licence) has led to important initiatives such as the <a href="https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/">NIfTI</a> file format (MRS file formats are an absolute mess), <a href="https://openneuro.org/">OpenNeuro</a>, <a href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io/">BIDS</a> and many others.</p>

            <p>Whilst I think ABfit is extremely useful as an MRS analysis method, its greater value is having an accompanying paper with a detailed explanation of the theory and justification for each stage of the algorithm. The method is also open source, and all code/data is freely available to fully reproduce the results of the paper <a href="https://github.com/martin3141/abfit_paper">github link</a>. Finally, ABfit is integrated into a comprehensive MRS analysis package "SPectroscopy ANalysis Tools" <a href="https://github.com/martin3141/spant">spant</a>, written in R, to aid the development of custom processing pipelines, batch analyses, data visualization and statistical interpretation.</p>

            <p>The hope is that open and transparent methods encourages greater scrutiny and acknowledgment of their limitations - a necessary requirement for improvement. I have seen this in happening in the fMRI world, from the perspective of an interested outsider, and I think MRS would benefit greatly from a similar culture. I've played a small part to promote this type of activity in the past through the TARQUIN software and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tarquin_users_group">users' group</a>, however I'm pleased to see bigger and better efforts currently underway thanks to Georg Oeltzschner, Brian Soher and Will Clarke's creation of the <a href="https://mrshub.org/">MRSHub</a>. Let's hope that fostering a culture of openness and transparency in MRS research will give it the final push needed to become an essential clinical tool.</p>
