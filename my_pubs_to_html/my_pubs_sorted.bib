  abstract	= {Proton MRS ( H MRS) provides noninvasive, quantitative
		  metabolite profiles of tissue and has been shown to aid the
		  clinical management of several brain diseases. Although
		  most modern clinical MR scanners support MRS capabilities,
		  routine use is largely restricted to specialized centers
		  with good access to MR research support. Widespread
		  adoption has been slow for several reasons, and technical
		  challenges toward obtaining reliable good-quality results
		  have been identified as a contributing factor. Considerable
		  progress has been made by the research community to address
		  many of these challenges, and in this paper a consensus is
		  presented on deficiencies in widely available MRS
		  methodology and validated improvements that are currently
		  in routine use at several clinical research institutions.
		  In particular, the localization error for the PRESS
		  localization sequence was found to be unacceptably high at
		  3 T, and use of the semi-adiabatic localization by
		  adiabatic selective refocusing sequence is a recommended
		  solution. Incorporation of simulated metabolite basis sets
		  into analysis routines is recommended for reliably
		  capturing the full spectral detail available from short TE
		  acquisitions. In addition, the importance of achieving a
		  highly homogenous static magnetic field (B ) in the
		  acquisition region is emphasized, and the limitations of
		  current methods and hardware are discussed. Most
		  recommendations require only software improvements, greatly
		  enhancing the capabilities of clinical MRS on existing
		  hardware. Implementation of these recommendations should
		  strengthen current clinical applications and advance
		  progress toward developing and validating new MRS

		  Twenty-seven pediatric brain tumor patients (n = 17

		  variance (ANOVA) on ranks were used to analyze the mean T
		  relaxation times and metabolite concentrations for each
		  tissue group and paired Mann-Whitney U-tests were
		  performed. The mean T relaxation of water was measured as
		  181 msec, 123 msec, 90 msec, and 86 msec in pilocytic
		  astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, basal ganglia, and white

		  relaxation time of NAA was significantly shorter in

		  (P < 0.001). Overall, the metabolite concentrations
		  were underestimated by ∼22% when default T values were

		  from 3T scanners in classifying pediatric brain tumors. A
		  total of 41 pediatric patients with brain tumors (17
		  medulloblastomas, 20 pilocytic astrocytomas, and 4
		  ependymomas) were scanned across four different hospitals.
		  Raw spectroscopy data were processed using TARQUIN.
		  Borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique was
		  used to correct for the data skewness. Different
		  classifiers were trained using linear discriminative
		  analysis, support vector machine, and random forest
		  techniques. Support vector machine had the highest balanced
		  accuracy for discriminating the three tumor types. The
		  balanced accuracy achieved was higher than the balanced
		  accuracy previously reported for similar multi-center
		  dataset from 1.5T magnets with echo time 20 to 32 ms alone.
		  This study showed that 3T MRS can detect key differences in
		  metabolite profiles for the main types of childhood tumors.

  abstract	= {The rare pediatric embryonal tumors retinoblastoma,
		  medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma derive from
		  neuroectodermal tissue and share similar histopathological
		  features despite different anatomical locations and diverse
		  clinical outcomes. As metabolism can reflect genetic and
		  histological features, we investigated whether the
		  metabolism of embryonal tumors reflects their similar
		  histology, shared developmental and neural origins, or
		  tumor location. We undertook metabolic profiling on 50
		  retinoblastoma, 39 medulloblastoma and 70 neuroblastoma
		  using high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic
		  resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Mean metabolite
		  concentrations identified several metabolites that were
		  significantly different between the tumor groups including
		  taurine, hypotaurine, glutamate, glutamine, GABA,
		  phosphocholine, N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glycine and
		  myoinositol, < 0.0017. Unsupervised multivariate analysis
		  found that each tumor group clustered separately, with a
		  unique metabolic profile, influenced by their underlying
		  clinical diversity. Taurine was notably high in all tumors
		  consistent with prior evidence from embryonal tumors.
		  Retinoblastoma and medulloblastoma were more metabolically
		  similar, sharing features associated with the central
		  nervous system (CNS). Neuroblastoma had features consistent
		  with neural tissue, but also contained significantly higher
		  myoinositol and altered glutamate-glutamine ratio,
		  suggestive of differences in the underlying metabolism of
		  embryonal tumors located outside of the CNS. Despite the
		  histological similarities and shared neural metabolic
		  features, we show that individual neuroectodermal derived
		  embryonal tumors can be distinguished by tissue metabolic
		  profile. Pathway analysis suggests the
		  alanine-aspartate-glutamate and taurine-hypotaurine
		  metabolic pathways may be the most pertinent pathways to
		  investigate for novel therapeutic strategies. This work
		  strengthens our understanding of the biology and metabolic
		  pathways underlying neuroectodermal derived embryonal

		  during- or post-tDCS compared to pre-tDCS levels, however,
		  there was large degree of variability across participants.
		  Although cerebellar tDCS did not affect visuomotor
		  adaptation, surprisingly cerebellar tDCS increased motor

		  major difference in the inter-scanner CV for ADC, D, MD and
		  FA was observed when analysing the 1.5T and 3T scanners

  pages		= {1222--1229},
  abstract	= {(1) H MRS thermometry has been investigated for brain
		  trauma and hypothermia monitoring applications but has not
		  been explored in brain tumours. The proton resonance
		  frequency (PRF) of water is dependent on temperature but is
		  also influenced by microenvironment factors, such as fast
		  proton exchange with macromolecules, ionic concentration
		  and magnetic susceptibility. (1) H MRS has been utilized
		  for brain tumour diagnostic and prognostic purposes in
		  children; however, the water PRF measure may provide
		  complementary information to further improve
		  characterization. Water PRF values were investigated from a
		  repository of MRS data acquired from childhood brain
		  tumours and children with apparently normal brains. The
		  cohort consisted of histologically proven glioma (22),
		  medulloblastoma (19) and control groups (28, MRS in both
		  the basal ganglia and parietal white matter regions). All
		  data were acquired at 1.5 T using a short TE (30 ms)
		  single voxel spectroscopy (PRESS) protocol. Water PRF
		  values were calculated using methyl creatine and total
		  choline. Spectral peak amplitude weighted averaging was
		  used to improve the accuracy of the measurements. Mean PRF
		  values were significantly larger for medulloblastoma
		  compared with glioma, with a difference in the means of
		  0.0147 ppm (p < 0.05), while the mean PRF for glioma
		  was significantly lower than for the healthy cohort, with a
		  difference in the means of 0.0061 ppm (p < 0.05).
		  This would suggest the apparent temperature of the glioma
		  group was ~1.5 °C higher than the medulloblastomas and
		  ~0.7 °C higher than a healthy brain. However, the PRF
		  shift may not reflect a change in temperature, given that
		  alterations in protein content, microstructure and ionic
		  concentration contribute to PRF shifts. Measurement of
		  these effects could also be used as a supplementary
		  biomarker, and further investigation is required. This
		  study has shown that the water PRF value has the potential
		  to be used for characterizing childhood brain tumours,
		  which has not been reported previously. Copyright © 2014

		  imaging water reference acquisition.},
  abstract	= {Purpose: Accurate and fast (1) H MR spectroscopic imaging
		  (MRSI) water reference scans are important for absolute
		  quantification of metabolites. However, the additional
		  acquisition time required often precludes the water
		  reference quantitation method for MRSI studies. Sensitivity
		  encoding (SENSE) is a successful MR technique developed to
		  reduce scan time. This study quantitatively assesses the
		  accuracy of SENSE for water reference MRSI data
		  acquisition, compared with the more commonly used reduced
		  resolution technique. Methods: 2D MRSI water reference data
		  were collected from a phantom and three volunteers at 3
		  Tesla for full acquisition (306 s); 2× reduced resolution
		  (64 s) and SENSE R = 3 (56 s) scans. Water amplitudes
		  were extracted using MRS quantitation software (TARQUIN).
		  Intensity maps and Bland-Altman statistics were generated
		  to assess the accuracy of the fast-MRSI techniques.
		  Results: The average mean and standard deviation of
		  differences from the full acquisition were 2.1 ± 3.2\%
		  for SENSE and 10.3 ± 10.7\% for the reduced resolution
		  technique, demonstrating that SENSE acquisition is
		  approximately three times more accurate than the reduced
		  resolution technique. Conclusion: SENSE was shown to
		  accurately reconstruct water reference data for the
		  purposes of in vivo absolute metabolite quantification,
		  offering significant improvement over the more commonly
		  used reduced resolution technique. Magn Reson Med

  abstract	= {Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor
		  occurring in childhood and is a significant cause of
		  morbidity and mortality in pediatric oncology. More intense
		  treatment strategies are recommended for patients
		  displaying high-risk factors; however, considerable
		  variation in outcome remains, indicating a need for
		  improved predictive markers. In this study, (1)H magnetic
		  resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to investigate
		  noninvasive molecular biomarkers of survival in
		  medulloblastoma.MRS was performed on a series of 35
		  biopsy-confirmed medulloblastoma cases. One case was
		  excluded because of poor quality MRS. The prognostic value
		  of MRS detectable biomarkers was investigated using Cox
		  regression, retrospectively (N = 15). A subsequent
		  validation analysis (N = 19) was also performed to reduce
		  the chance of type I errors. Where available,
		  high-resolution ex vivo MRS of biopsy tissue was used to
		  confirm biomarker assignments.The retrospective analysis
		  revealed that creatine, glutamate, and glycine were markers
		  of survival (P < 0.01). The validation analysis showed that
		  glutamate was a robust marker, with a hazard ration (HR) of
		  8.0 for the full dataset (P = 0.0003, N = 34). A good

		  using a protocol which increases the metabolite information
		  improves the diagnostic accuracy.Seventy-eight patients

		  Discrimination of 29 medulloblastomas, 11 ependymomas and
		  38 pilocytic astrocytomas (PILOAs) was evaluated.
		  Single-voxel MRS was undertaken prior to diagnosis (1.5 T
		  Point-Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS), Proton Brain Exam
		  (PROBE) or Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM), echo
		  time (TE) 20-32 ms and 135-136 ms). MRS data were processed
		  using two strategies, determination of metabolite
		  concentrations using TARQUIN software and automatic feature
		  extraction with Peak Integration (PI). Linear Discriminant
		  Analysis (LDA) was applied to this data to produce
		  diagnostic classifiers. An evaluation of the diagnostic
		  accuracy was performed based on resampling to measure the
		  Balanced Accuracy Rate (BAR).The accuracy of the diagnostic
		  classifiers for discriminating the three tumour types was
		  found to be high (BAR 0.98) when a combination of TE was

		  morbidity rate of all childhood tumour groups and new
		  methods are required to improve clinical management. (1)H
		  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows non-invasive
		  concentration measurements of small molecules present in
		  tumour tissue, providing clinically useful imaging
		  biomarkers. The primary aim of this study was to
		  investigate whether MRS detectable molecules can predict
		  the survival of paediatric brain tumour patients. PATIENTS
		  AND METHODS: Short echo time (30ms) single voxel (1)H MRS
		  was performed on children attending Birmingham Children's
		  Hospital with a suspected brain tumour and 115 patients
		  were included in the survival analysis. Patients were
		  followed-up for a median period of 35months and
		  Cox-Regression was used to establish the prognostic value
		  of individual MRS detectable molecules. A multivariate
		  model of survival was also investigated to improve
		  prognostic power. RESULTS: Lipids and scyllo-inositol
		  predicted poor survival whilst glutamine and N-acetyl
		  aspartate predicted improved survival (p<0.05). A
		  multivariate model of survival based on three MRS
		  biomarkers predicted survival with a similar accuracy to
		  histologic grading (p<5e-5). A negative correlation between
		  lipids and glutamine was found, suggesting a functional
		  link between these molecules. CONCLUSIONS: MRS detectable
		  biomolecules have been identified that predict survival of
		  paediatric brain tumour patients across a range of tumour
		  types. The evaluation of these biomarkers in large
		  prospective studies of specific tumour types should be
		  undertaken. The correlation between lipids and glutamine
		  provides new insight into paediatric brain tumour
		  metabolism that may present novel targets for therapy.},

		  BT4C glioma cells were treated with 50 µ m
		  cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum II (cisplatin), a commonly

		  saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid resonances early
		  during the exposure to cisplatin. The fatty acid CH(2)
		  /CH(3) ratio was unaltered by treatment after allowing for
		  contributions of macromolecules. Polyunsaturated fatty
		  acids increased on treatment, with the group -CH=CH-CH(2)
		  -CH=CH- accounting for all the unsaturated fatty acid
		  signals. Transmission electron microscopy, in addition to
		  Nile red and 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole co-staining,

		  In conclusion, an increase in the size of the lipid

  volume	= {6},

  pages		= {19},
  abstract	= {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Propionic acidaemia (PA) results
		  from deficiency of Propionyl CoA carboxylase, the commonest
		  form presenting in the neonatal period. Despite best
		  current management, PA is associated with severe
		  neurological sequelae, in particular movement disorders
		  resulting from basal ganglia infarction, although the
		  pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The role of liver
		  transplantation remains controversial but may confer some
		  neuro-protection. The present study utilises quantitative
		  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate brain
		  metabolite alterations in propionic acidaemia during
		  metabolic stability and acute encephalopathic episodes.
		  METHODS: Quantitative MRS was used to evaluate brain
		  metabolites in eight children with neonatal onset propionic
		  acidaemia, with six elective studies acquired during
		  metabolic stability and five studies during acute
		  encephalopathic episodes. MRS studies were acquired
		  concurrently with clinically indicated MR imaging studies
		  at 1.5 Tesla. LCModel software was used to provide
		  metabolite quantification. Comparison was made with a
		  dataset of MRS metabolite concentrations from a cohort of
		  children with normal appearing MR imaging. RESULTS: MRI
		  findings confirm the vulnerability of basal ganglia to
		  infarction during acute encephalopathy. We identified
		  statistically significant decreases in basal ganglia
		  glutamate+glutamine and N-Acetylaspartate, and increase in
		  lactate, during encephalopathic episodes. In white matter
		  lactate was significantly elevated but other metabolites
		  not significantly altered. Metabolite data from two
		  children who had received liver transplantation were not
		  significantly different from the comparator group.
		  CONCLUSIONS: The metabolite alterations seen in propionic
		  acidaemia in the basal ganglia during acute encephalopathy
		  reflect loss of viable neurons, and a switch to anaerobic
		  respiration. The decrease in glutamine+glutamate supports
		  the hypothesis that they are consumed to replenish a
		  compromised Krebs cycle and that this is a marker of
		  compromised aerobic respiration within brain tissue. Thus
		  there is a need for improved brain protective strategies
		  during acute metabolic decompensations. MRS provides a
		  non-invasive tool for which could be employed to evaluate
		  novel treatments aimed at restoring basal ganglia
		  homeostasis. The results from the liver transplantation
		  sub-group supports the hypothesis that liver
		  transplantation provides systemic metabolic stability by
		  providing a hepatic pool of functional propionyl CoA
		  carboxylase, thus preventing further acute decompensations
		  which are associated with the risk of brain infarction.},

		  presented. Analysis is performed in the time domain using
		  non-negative least squares, and a new method for applying
		  soft constraints to signal amplitudes is used to improve
		  fitting stability. Initial point truncation and Hankel
		  singular value decomposition water removal are used to
		  reduce baseline interference. Three methods were used to
		  test performance. First, metabolite concentrations from six
		  healthy volunteers at 3 T were compared with LCModel.
		  Second, a Monte-Carlo simulation was performed and results
		  were compared with LCModel to test the accuracy of the new

		  spectra, acquired clinically at 1.5 T, to test robustness
		  to noisy, abnormal, artifactual, and poorly shimmed
		  spectra. Discrepancies of less than approximately 20\% were
		  found between the main metabolite concentrations determined
		  by TARQUIN and LCModel from healthy volunteer data. The
		  Monte-Carlo simulation revealed that errors in metabolite
		  concentration estimates were comparable with LCModel.
		  TARQUIN analyses were also found to be robust to clinical

		  improved non-invasive diagnosis, characterisation and
		  prognostic biomarkers. Metabolite profiles derived from
		  in-vivo MRS have been shown to provide such information.
		  Studies indicate that using optimum a priori information on
		  metabolite contents in the construction of linear
		  combination (LC) models of MR spectra leads to improved
		  metabolite profile estimation. Glycine (Gly) is usually
		  neglected in such models due to strong overlap with
		  myo-inositol (mI) and a low concentration in normal brain.
		  However, biological studies indicate that Gly is abundant
		  in high-grade brain tumours. This study aimed to
		  investigate the quantitation of Gly in paediatric brain
		  tumours using MRS analysed by LCModel, and its potential as
		  a non-invasive biomarker of malignancy. Single-voxel MRS
		  was performed using PRESS (TR 1500 ms, TE 30 ms/135 ms) on
		  a 1.5 T scanner. Forty-seven cases (18 high grade (HG), 17
		  low grade (LG), 12 ungraded) were retrospectively selected
		  if both short-TE and long-TE MRS (n = 33) or short-TE MRS
		  and high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) of matched
		  surgical samples (n = 15) were available. The inclusion of
		  Gly in LCModel analyses led to significantly reduced fit
		  residues for both short-TE and long-TE MRS (p < 0.05). The
		  Gly concentrations estimated from short-TE MRS were
		  significantly correlated with the long-TE values (R = 0.91,
		  p < 0.001). The Gly concentration estimated by LCModel was
		  significantly higher in HG versus LG tumours for both
		  short-TE (p < 1e-6) and long-TE (p = 0.003) MRS. This was
		  consistent with the HRMAS results, which showed a
		  significantly higher normalised Gly concentration in HG
		  tumours (p < 0.05) and a significant correlation with the
		  normalised Gly concentration measured from short-TE in-vivo
		  MRS (p < 0.05). This study suggests that glycine can be
		  reliably detected in paediatric brain tumours using in-vivo
		  MRS on standard clinical scanners and that it is a
		  promising biomarker of tumour aggressiveness.},

		  characterisation of these tumours is important for
		  providing novel biomarkers of disease and identifying

		  new therapies. 1H magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy (1H
		  HR-MAS) is a powerful tool for determining metabolite

		  METHODS: Forty tissue samples from 29 children with glial
		  and primitive neuro-ectodermal tumours were analysed using
		  HR-MAS (600 MHz Varian gHX nanoprobe). Tumour spectra were
		  fitted to a library of individual metabolite spectra to
		  provide metabolite values. These values were then used in a
		  two tailed t-test and multi-variate analysis employing a

		  Glial tumours had significantly (two tailed t-test p <

		  with primitive neuro-ectodermal tumours. Classification

		  presented for the automatic time domain analysis of
		  high-resolution NMR spectra. The TARQUIN algorithm uses a
		  set of basis functions obtained by quantum mechanical
		  simulation using predetermined parameters. Each basis
		  function is optimized by subdividing it into a set of
		  signals from magnetically equivalent spins and varying the
		  simulated chemical shifts of each of these groups to match
		  the signal undergoing analysis. A novel approach to the
		  standard multidimensional minimization problem is
		  introduced based on evaluating the fit resulting from
		  different permutations of possible chemical shifts,
		  obtained from one-dimensional searches. Results are
		  presented from the analysis of (1)H proton magic angle
		  spinning spectra of cell lines illustrating the robustness
		  of the method in a typical application. Simulation was used
		  to investigate the biggest peak shifts that can be
		  tolerated.},
